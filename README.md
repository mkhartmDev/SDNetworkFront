### Additional Features
In addition to the features depicted in the images above, we also had like/unlike functionality, as well as a number of likes per post. We developed search bar functionality in both the front and back ends. The search results page returns a maximum of 24 search results, with "More" and "Less" buttons to show more or fewer results. The settings page allows the user to change all but their username.
